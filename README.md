# Numbers, Dates, Intl and Timers – Bankist App

This project is part of the practice work from Jonas Schmedtmann’s Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy.  
In this section, the focus is on advanced handling of **numbers**, **dates**, **internationalization (Intl)**, and **timers** in JavaScript – all within the context of the Bankist App.

## Overview

After learning about common JavaScript data structures and strings, this section covers:

- **Numbers**: Formatting, parsing, working with floats and integers
- **Dates**: Creating, formatting, comparing, and calculating with dates
- **Intl (Internationalization)**: Formatting numbers and dates for different locales
- **Timers**: Using `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for time-based actions

All examples and practice are based on the ongoing Bankist App project.

## What You’ll Learn

- Practical usage of numbers and dates in JavaScript
- Making your app locale-aware using the `Intl` API
- Creating countdowns, intervals, and timeout-based events
- Applying these concepts in a realistic banking app scenario

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Follow along with the course, practicing in `script.js`.
4. Explore how numbers, dates, formatting, and timers are used in a real-world app.
